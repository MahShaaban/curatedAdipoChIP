Title: A Curated ChIP-Seq Dataset of MDI-induced Differentiated Adipocytes 
  (3T3-L1)
Version: 0.99.2
Year: 2019
Description: A curated dataset of publicly available ChIP-sequencing of 
  transcription factors, chromatin remodelers and histone modifications in the 
  3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line. The package document the data collection,
  pre-processing and processing of the data. In addition to the documentation,
  the package contains the scripts that was used to generated the data.
